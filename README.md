# Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a simple demo application to send commands to connected bluetooth devices (ESP32 dev board used in this case).
A side goal is to do this using native web components with typescript as to not rely on any frameworks or burdensome libraries.
Great success üëç

# Setup:
```npm install```

# Run dev with HMR using esbuild:
```npm run dev```

# Build the project app.js bundle
This builds all web components to a root index (app.js) which the index.html file points to.
```npm run build```

# Test/serve the built bundle:
```npm run serve```
